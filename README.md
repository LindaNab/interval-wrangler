# Playground for interval wrangling
The initial purpose of this repository is combining datasets with variables varying over time into one dataset with the variables combined and their corresponding intervals.

## Example
**

## Types of overlapping intervals
- Overlapping starts: the second interval starts between the start and the end of the first interval (including starting on same day)
- Overlapping ends: the second interval ends between the start and the end of the first interval (including ending on same day)
- Full overlap: the second interval starts before the first interval starts and ends after the first interval ends
